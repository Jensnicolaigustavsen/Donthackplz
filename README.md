# Donthackplz
Im a programmer with alot of experience in c++. Started learning this back in 2012 to win in all games. I was a bad looser, and I still am. But I will keep pushing untill I make it! Nothing can stop us if we just work hard enough. I believe in Cryptocurrencies. I believe in the technology and now I want to become a part of something big, in order for me to build my carrier and as an early adaptor. Im currently digging into Hedera Hasgraph, but im mostly looking for useful healthcare and communication platforms that can save human lifes to begin with. Please contact me if you want me in your team. Best Regards Jens, Norway
